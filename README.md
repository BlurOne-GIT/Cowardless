## The problem
Have you ever engaged in an intense PvP battle, only to have your opponent disconnect abruptly? It’s frustrating, right? You’ve meticulously set up a trap, but they slip away because you missed their exact disconnection point. Cowards ruin the thrill of combat.

## The solution
Introducing Cowardless, the ultimate plugin for Minecraft warriors. Say goodbye to cowardly opponents who vanish mid-fight. Here’s how it works:
1. **Clone Activation:** When you’re in combat or constantly taking damage (think drowning or lava), Cowardless springs into action. If you attempt to disconnect, a clone takes your place on the server—a mere illusion for other players.
2. **Transfer of Consequences:** But here’s the twist: Everything the clone experiences—position, health, inventory, even death—gets transferred back to you when you log back in.
3. **Automatic Despawn:** Fear not! If spared and left unattended, the clone will eventually despawn, allowing you to enjoy the peacefulness of having disconnected.

## The extra info
In the `config.yml`, you can adjust how long a player is considered to be in combat, and how long a clone lasts before despawning. You can also turn on a logger that will print to the console when someone spawns an NPC, and a feature that will add the red vignette effect to a player when they are in combat, so that they know not to disconnect.
If you have any ideas or feature requests for the plugin, feel free to share them in the [repo's discussions](https://github.com/BlurOne-GIT/Cowardless/discussions).
