# Cowardless
A Minecraft plugin that replaces players who log out during combat with an NPC to be killed instead.

## The problem
Have you ever engaged in an intense PvP battle, only to have your opponent disconnect abruptly? It’s frustrating, right? You’ve meticulously set up a trap, but they slip away because you missed their exact disconnection point. Cowards ruin the thrill of combat.

## The solution
Introducing Cowardless, the ultimate plugin for Minecraft warriors. Say goodbye to cowardly opponents who vanish mid-fight. Here’s how it works:
1. **Clone Activation:** When you’re in combat or constantly taking damage (think drowning or lava), Cowardless springs into action. If you attempt to disconnect, a clone takes your place on the server—a mere illusion for other players.
2. **Transfer of Consequences:** But here’s the twist: Everything the clone experiences—position, health, inventory, even death—gets transferred back to you when you log back in.
3. **Automatic Despawn:** Fear not! If spared and left unattended, the clone will eventually despawn, allowing you to enjoy the peacefulness of having disconected.

## The extra info
In the `config.yml`, you can adjust how long a player is considered to be in combat, and how long a clone lasts before despwaning.
If you have any ideas or feature requests for the plugin, feel free to share them in the repository [repo's discussions](https://github.com/BlurOne-GIT/Cowardless/discussions).
